Class Employee {
    int id; 
    string name; 
    string department; 
    bool: isWorking;

    public:
        saveEmployeeToDatabase()
        printEmployeeDetailReportInXML()
        printEmployeeDetailReportInCSV()
        terminateEmployee()

SOLID Principles:
1. Single Responsibility -
    Following

2. Open Closed - 
    Not following, if new report type need to be added, it would change this class

3. Liskov Substitution - 
    Not applicable as no child class

4. Interface Segragation - 
    Not used

5. Dependency Inversion -
    Not applicable as its abstract class


Other Improvements:
1. Excessive new lines
2. Bad Formatting
3. Better naming is possible
